You may remember me from [**last week's post all about bats and their viruses**](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/gehvui/why_do_viruses_often_come_from_bats_a_discussion/)! This week, it's all about origin stories. *Batman's parents. Spiderman's uncle. Heroes always seem to need a dead loved one...?*

*But what about the villains?* **Where did CoVID-19 come from?** Check out [**this PDF**](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kAHSEx9-eIyVIahczH8itHaUm9jI9WX7) for a much easier and more streamlined reading experience.

# I'm here today to discuss some of the theories that have been circulating about the origins of CoVID-19. My focus will be on which theories are more plausible than others.

\---

**\[TL;DR\]: I am very confident that SARS-CoV-2 has no connection to the Wuhan Institute of Virology or any other laboratory. Not genetic engineering, not intentional evolution, not an accidental release. The most plausible scenario, by a landslide, is that SARS-CoV-2 jumped from a bat (or other species) into a human, in the wild.**

[**Here's a PDF copy**](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kAHSEx9-eIyVIahczH8itHaUm9jI9WX7) **of this post's content for easier reading/sharing.** *But don't worry, everything in that PDF is included below, either in this top post or in the subsequently linked comments.*

A bit about me: **My background is in high risk biocontainment viruses, and my PhD was specifically focused on Ebola-, Hanta-, and Flavi-viruses.** If you're looking for some light reading, here's my dissertation: ([**PDF**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/168dmb0nOpqwL7Imil7OHLANQwwy_Hwo-/view?usp=sharing) | [**Metadata**](https://pqdtopen.proquest.com/doc/2273835368.html?FMT=ABS)). And here are the publications I've authored in scientific journals: ([**ORCID**](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2077-6685) | [**GoogleScholar**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8wCwbNUAAAAJ)). These days, I'm a medical student at the University of Pittsburgh, where I also research brain tumors and the viral vectors we could use to treat them.

\---

The main part of this post is going to consist of a **thorough, well-sourced, joke-filled,** and **Q&amp;A style** **run-down of all the reasons we can be pretty damn sure that SARS-CoV-2 emerged from zoonotic transmission.** More specifically, [the virus that causes CoVID-19](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/g8mjmo/has_a_patientfamily_memberfriend_told_you_that/) likely crossed over into humans from bats, somewhere in rural Hubei province.

**To put all the cards on the table, there are also a few disclaimers I need to say:**

&gt;Firstly, **if this post looks long (** *and I’m sorry, it is* **), then** **please skip around on it.**  *It’s a Q &amp; A. Go to the questions you’ve actually asked yourself!*  
&gt;  
&gt;Secondly, **if you’re reading this &amp; thinking** *“I should post a comment* *telling Jim he’s a fool for believing he can change people’s minds!”* I would urge you: please **read this footnote first** ([**1**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vRbACWf90iBC35xNOwlI5bWcUq0nNzLc/view?usp=sharing)).  
&gt;  
&gt;Thirdly, **if you’re reading this and thinking** *“Does anyone really* *believe that?”*  **please read this footnote** ([**2**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vRbACWf90iBC35xNOwlI5bWcUq0nNzLc/view?usp=sharing)).  
&gt;  
&gt;Fourthly, **if you’re already preparing a comment like** *“You can’t be 100%* *sure of that! Liar!!”* … **Then you’re right!** I cannot be *100%* sure. **Please read this footnote** ([**3**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vRbACWf90iBC35xNOwlI5bWcUq0nNzLc/view?usp=sharing)).  
&gt;  
&gt;And finally, **if you’re reading this and thinking:** *”Get a load of this* *pro-China bot/troll,”*  then I have to tell you, it has never been more clear that we have never met. **I am no fan of the Chinese government!** Check out this relevant footnote ([**4**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vRbACWf90iBC35xNOwlI5bWcUq0nNzLc/view?usp=sharing)).

* [**\[TL;DR\]:**](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/gk6y95/covid19_did_not_come_from_the_wuhan_institute_of/) SARS-CoV-2 has no connection to the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV). **(Top post)**
* [**Introduction:**](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/gk6y95/covid19_did_not_come_from_the_wuhan_institute_of/fqpa5du?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) Why this topic is so important, and the harms that these theories have caused.
* [**\[Q1\]:**](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/gk6y95/covid19_did_not_come_from_the_wuhan_institute_of/fqpa9kn/) Okay, but before I read any further, Jim, why can I trust you?
* [**\[Q2\]:**](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/gk6y95/covid19_did_not_come_from_the_wuhan_institute_of/fqpbagf/) Okay… So what proof do you actually have that the virus wasn’t cooked up in a lab?
   * [**2.1)**](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/gk6y95/covid19_did_not_come_from_the_wuhan_institute_of/fqpbagf/) The virus itself, to the eye of any virologist, is clearly not engineered.
   * [**2.2)**](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/gk6y95/covid19_did_not_come_from_the_wuhan_institute_of/fqpbt6o/) If someone had messed around with the genome, we would be able to detect it!
   * [**2.3)**](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/gk6y95/covid19_did_not_come_from_the_wuhan_institute_of/fqpby1u/) If it were created in a lab, SARS-CoV-2 would have been engineered by an idiot.
   * [**Addendum to Q2**](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/gk6y95/covid19_did_not_come_from_the_wuhan_institute_of/fqpbys1/)
* [**\[Q3\]:**](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/gk6y95/covid19_did_not_come_from_the_wuhan_institute_of/fqpc7c8/) What if they made it using accelerated evolution? Or passaging the virus in animals?
   * [**3.1)**](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/gk6y95/covid19_did_not_come_from_the_wuhan_institute_of/fqpc7c8/) SARS-CoV-2 could not have been made by passaging the virus in animals.
   * [**3.2)**](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/gk6y95/covid19_did_not_come_from_the_wuhan_institute_of/fqpc9om/) SARS-CoV-2 could not have been made by passaging in cells in a petri dish.
   * [**3.3)**](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/gk6y95/covid19_did_not_come_from_the_wuhan_institute_of/fqpcaz5/) If we increase the mutation rate, the virus doesn’t survive.
* [**\[Q4\]:**](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/gk6y95/covid19_did_not_come_from_the_wuhan_institute_of/fqpccr1/) Okay, so what if it was released from a lab accidentally?
   * [**4.1)**](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/gk6y95/covid19_did_not_come_from_the_wuhan_institute_of/fqpccr1/) Dr. Zhengli-Li Shi and WIV are very well respected in the world of biosecurity.
   * [**4.2)**](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/gk6y95/covid19_did_not_come_from_the_wuhan_institute_of/fqpce2z/) Likewise, we would probably know if the WIV had SARS-CoV-2 inside its freezers.
   * [**4.3)**](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/gk6y95/covid19_did_not_come_from_the_wuhan_institute_of/fqpcf33/) This doesn’t look anything like any laboratory accident we’ve ever seen before.
   * [**4.4)**](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/gk6y95/covid19_did_not_come_from_the_wuhan_institute_of/fqpcfs2/) The best evidence we have points to SARS-CoV-2 originating outside Wuhan.
* [**\[Q5\]:**](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/gk6y95/covid19_did_not_come_from_the_wuhan_institute_of/fqpcgy6/) Okay, tough guy. You seem awfully sure of yourself. What happened, then?
* [**\[Q6\]:**](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/gk6y95/covid19_did_not_come_from_the_wuhan_institute_of/fqpci3n?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) Yknow, Jim, I still don’t believe you. Got anything else?
* [**\[Q7\]:**](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/gk6y95/covid19_did_not_come_from_the_wuhan_institute_of/fqpcivn?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) What are your other favorite write ups on this topic?

As humans we see what is above ground, and only from a very particular perspective.

Most of us fail to notice the affection between animals.

We may notice it in our pets, but compartmentalise those behaviours to them. I believe most humans don’t consider the personalities of each rainbow lorikeet in a flock. We see them so quirky and full of life and love in our homes, but to imagine that each wild one has its’ own personality and love for each other, that the flock is truly a family group who cares about each other, seems to go unthought of by most people.

We see pigs be so loyal and sweet, and don’t think that the ones stuck in sow stalls, unable to move, unable to interact, have that exact same potential. We endorse the industries which year after year, now generation after generation, torture mass numbers of animals capable of love, compassion and empathy. We compartmentalise the ones that we see acting a way we admire, the ones that act like dogs. We are used to dogs being our best friends, we would never dream of hurting them. We despise cultures who torture and eat dogs. It is unthinkable to us. And here we are, almost all of us, blindly eating bacon that came from a tortured soul. One who never had the opportunity to feel love or joy. Who was brought in to the world to feel nothing but pain and distance, to then be slaughtered and consumed by a species who has lost touch with empathy stretching beyond the people of our closest circles. 

To walk through a forest, we miss the extraordinary life beneath our feet. We see the beautiful trees above ground, but I now suspect that the most breath taking realities are the ones we have overlooked. 

The trees, bacteria and fungus beneath us create a web. The connections of the mycelium stretch to the edge of each continent, or at least it did.

These vast expanses of connections, is it possible that a consciousness was born as a biproduct? Is it possible that mother nature is truly an intelligent organism? Human intelligence was selected for by the outcomes it produced, but could it not happen differently? A vast array of fungus, plants and bacteria, successful for simply staying alive, which spreads its tendrils and connects everything, just by chance creating a network not so different from a brain.

A brain which has lasted for hundreds of millions of years. One which maybe cannot influence the happenings of events above ground, but one that is in some way aware. It does not see, but does it smell? And feel? Does it do something similar to hearing? What is the experience like of such a different being? Is there some form of pheromone language which it processes thoughts in? Can it experience Pain? Anguish? Love?

Is there a way to investigate this? A way to monitor the mycelium for patterns like thoughts? Could we recognise them, and if we did, would it make any difference at all?

I hope beyond hope, that life lives elsewhere. Life that supports each other and does not destroy itself. Humans are truly the plague of this planet. The greedy always rise to the top. We see it in business and politics. Those who are willing to backstab and scramble will naturally be the ones who push everyone else out of the way. The liars, the selfish, the unempathetic. 

But I have never thought to look at that pattern on a species level. 

Humans as a collective, have lost touch with nature. We don’t consider it to be a part of us. We don’t consider it to be worth as much as us. The idea of giving up our obscene comforts to benefit nature is to ask too much. We have believed ourselves to be greater than the other branches of life, and we are killing the tree.

Will we wipe ourselves out? Will we survive long enough to wipe out nature entirely?

In this moment, I do hope we have doomed ourselves. I hope the damage we have done cannot be repaired. If humans die, nature will recover. It has time after time, it may take a long time, but she will return. But if we survive the coming chaos of climate change, to continue with our infrastructure and “advancement”, we will continue to push her down and down and down. Will we one day leave the planet and let her recover? I cannot imagine her future, and I am filled with so much sadness for this.

I dream of a world that we cannot create. 

One where people redefine what matters, and recognises our animal cousins as family who experience love and friendship. I wish for a future that humans reinvigorate mother nature. We allow our forests to return, and we stop trying to put ourselves above all else.

I imagine a future, or maybe just another world, where such inquisitive thought is directed to understand life. To understand our planet, our trees, our mycelium. Maybe to communicate between species, even between kingdoms. Does an intelligent species have to be set apart? Can we not continue to be humble and loving of everything around us?

I don’t believe humans are capable of this, so I guess I dream of a world without us."

Want to create a meaningful positive impact on our planet, even though you have a full workweek, university, or other responsibilities? The last few months I worked on www.workjointly.org, here you can find volunteering projects submitted by environmental non-profit initiatives from all over the globe. Current projects include marketing for a sustainable clothing initiative in Germany, assisting an Indonesian NGO with fundraising, or multiple IT related projects.

Jointly is not the first initiative that promotes online volunteering, but it differs a lot from other platforms. But, contrary to others Jointly has a complete focus on environmental projects. To make it accessible for everyone, Jointly is free for all parties involved and initiatives do not require to submit official documents or certificates to prove their well-doing. This makes the platform accessible for grassroots groups or initiatives from developing countries. To ensure the validity of the submitted projects, Jointly reviews every initiative manually.

Do you have an environmental non-profit initiative that could use some help? Let me know or submit a project on the website!

Feedback on all this is more than welcome.

Have a great day! :)"

I was thinking about shooting it with an airsoft rifle, but wanted to try a more humane approach. Sorry that the video is very blurry, but we believe it's a Towhee or a House Sparrow. Audio is attached.

It's much louder than in the video lol.

It has gotten more extreme weeks after I recorded the video. After some research, I found that it is probably hitting it's reflection, and we have out CD's, Cardboard, a picture of a hawk, a stuffed animal, nothing. Can anyone please give me a humane way to make it go away.  I do not appreciate being woke up by hard pecking at 5 am each and everyday. He has already cracked my window and broken through the screen we have over it.

 Thanks and God Bless!"

nature,t3_g9mpmx,Concept - Finding the motivation to go outside into nature via a herb collection story," 

I love collecting herbs in the wild, its like finding treasures! And thus its motivating me to go outside in the first place, which can sometimes be a challenge tbh xD

And now since I have to do a project about plants in uni for my design class I decided to make it a ""Herb Collecting in the Wild"" thingy in context of a semi fantasy story. You might not be able to imagine the technology well, its not important anyway, I just want to know more about how I could make it cool for others, i dont just want to cook my own little dandelion soup :D

So imagine you are walking through the woods, as a young apprentice of a deceased herbs master, with his book in tow and his voice, trapped in the pages, guiding you through the forest. The little village you come from has recently seen some mysterious events and through the discovery of the herbs, you can slowly unwrap what has happened. You move through the story be scanning certain checkpoints in the area, your phone then shows you the plant that typically grows in this place and where you might find it.

Now many of you might know their herbs anyway, but do you think, for someone who doesnt know anything yet, this would be a nice little motivation for them to go outside and have a look? Or do you find it kinda boring. Thats fine, I wanna make it as interesting as possible!

Share any ideas and thoughts that you have if you want to :)
