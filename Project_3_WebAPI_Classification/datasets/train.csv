The 4.5 years I spent getting a PhD were dedicated to studying antibody responses against emerging viruses like Ebola and Marburg. So you can imagine how much time I’ve spent thinking about bats. 

Here’s some answers about why they always seem to be the culprit when it comes to outbreaks.

---

# Q: Why is it always bats? (that harbor dangerous viruses that spill over into humans)

# A: It's complicated.

**TL;DR - Bats are a perfect storm of: genetic proximity to humans (as fellow mammals), keystone species interacting with many others in the environment (including via respiratory secretions and blood-transmission), great immune systems for spreading dangerous viruses, flight, social structure, hibernation, etc.**

---

You may not be fully aware, but unless your head has been stuffed in the sand, you've probably heard, at some point, that X virus ""***lives in bats***."" It's been said about: **Rabies, Hendra/Nipah, Ebola, Chikungunya, Rift Valley Fever, St. Louis Encephalitis, and yes, SARS, MERS**, and, now probably **SARS-CoV-2** (with the addition of another intermediate species?)

[Bats really do harbor more viruses than other species groups](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/06/bats-really-do-harbor-more-dangerous-viruses-other-species)!

**But why? Why is it always bats?** The answer lies in the unique niche bats fill in our ecosystem.

# Bats are not that far off from humans genetically speaking

They're placental mammals that give birth to live young, that are [about as related to us (distance-wise) as dogs](https://www.researchgate.net/deref/http%3A%2F%2Fdx.doi.org%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.0030002?_sg%5B0%5D=5-_-2_pgWIhDr6YQfI8RQIcqJrXoSs-GlPcy1oj31o-lwx93Pqr2XNO5gRdpjh8RlWuimjxHEuIxQAzZUsOaC2v-Jg.4ZxtM1n7PdeIguwFA_xY00LN0cqRu784dZOaF6gdx3I7e7d3ReGdPq-cF2UejDf7cwWIv8yDiL4Q3eOetfyk6w). Which means **\~84% of our genomes are identical to bat genomes**. Just slightly less related to us than, say, mice or rats (\~85%).

*(this estimate is based upon associations in phylogeny. Yes I know bats are a huge group, but it's useful to estimate at this level right now.)*

Why does this matter? **Well, genetic relatedness isn't just a fun fancy % number. It also means that all the proteins on the surface of our cells are similar as well.**

For example, [**SARS-CoV-2 is thought to enter our cells using the ACE2 receptor**](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/367/6485/1444) (*which is a lil protein that plays a role in regulating blood pressure on the outside of cells in our lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines*). [**The ACE2 between humans and bats is about 80.5% similar**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20567988/) (*this link is to a paper using bat ACE2 to figure out viral entry. I just plugged the bat ACE2 and human ACE2 into [protein blast](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE=Proteins) to get that 80.5% number*).

To give you an idea of what that means for a virus that's crossing species barriers, CD4 ([the protein HIV uses to get into T cells](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18383039/)) is about 98% similar between [chimpanzees](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/8/3229) and humans. HIV likely had a much easier time than SARS-CoV-2 of jumping onto our ship, but SARS-CoV-2 also has a trick up its sleeve: [an extremely promiscuous viral entry protein](https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/from-bats-to-human-lungs-the-evolution-of-a-coronavirus).

These viruses use their entry protein and bind to the target receptor to enter cells. The more similar the target protein is between species, the easier it will be for viruses to jump ship from their former hosts and join us on a not-so-fun adventure.

Another aspect of this is that **there are just so many dang bats**. There are roughly [1,300 bat species](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/group/bats/) making up [20-25% of all mammals](https://www.csu.edu/cerc/researchreports/documents/BatsActivityGuide.pdf). So the chances of getting a virus from a bat? Pretty good from the get go. *If you had to pick a mammalian species at random, there's a pretty good chance it's gonna be a rodent or a bat.*

# Bats are in a perfect place to serve as a nexus connecting a bunch of different species together and transmitting viruses

Various bat species do all or some of:

* [**Drink the blood of other animals**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire_bat) ([*and are in turn fed on by mosquitos*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6466281/))
* [**Eat, piss, and shit**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10900029/) on fruit that other animals eat
* [**Eat moths, gnats, flies, and mosquitos**](https://news.wisc.edu/study-bolsters-bats-reputation-as-mosquito-devourers/) that have fed on live or dead animals
* [**Help to pollinate**](https://ucanr.edu/sites/PollenNation/Meet_The_Pollinators/Bats) and spread seeds for a zillion different important plants
* [**Shit on cave floors, producing precious guano**](https://eos.org/articles/how-bat-breath-and-guano-can-change-the-shapes-of-caves) that is used by fungi and bacteria
* [**These microorganisms**](https://books.google.com/books?id=IEZwx8PfP5IC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;dq=cave+fungus+eaten+by+salamanders&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4fy-DzWE8t&amp;sig=ACfU3U1imlPihOHzUXxyw_4hU7FuI_j-bg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiq9pbu5PLoAhVug-AKHXQmCqAQ6AEwFnoECAoQKA#v=onepage&amp;q=cave%20fungus%20eaten%20by%20salamanders&amp;f=false) are then, in turn, eaten by fish, salamanders, frogs, etc.
* [**Bats are also food**](http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20170118-monstrous-spiders-and-centipedes-that-prey-on-large-animals) for hawks, weasels, and even arthropods like spiders and centipedes. And yes, even humans eat bats.

**All of this means two things:**

1. **bats are getting and giving viruses from all of these different activities**. Every time they drink the blood of another animal or eat a mosquito that has done the same, they get some of that species' viruses. And when they urinate on fruit that we eat, or if we directly eat bats, we get those viruses as well.
2. **Bats are, like it or not, an extremely crucial part of the ecosystem that cannot be eliminated.** So their viruses are also here to stay. **The best thing we can do is pass laws that make it illegal to eat, farm, and sell bats and other wild zoonotic animals**, so that we can reduce our risk of contracting their viruses. We can also pass laws protecting their ecological niche, so that they stay in the forest, and we stay in the city!

# The bat immune system is well tuned to fight and harbor viruses

[Their immune systems are actually hyper-reactive](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bats-immune-system-viruses-ebola-marburg-people), getting rid of viruses from their own cells extremely well. This is probably an adaptation that results from the second point: if you encounter a ton of different viruses, then you also have to avoid getting sick yourself.

*This sounds counter-intuitive, right? Why would an animal with an extremely good immune system be a good vector to give us (and other animals) its viruses?*

Well, the theory goes that [**bats act as a sort of ""training school""**](https://www.discovermagazine.com/health/why-bats-are-breeding-grounds-for-deadly-diseases-like-ebola-and-sars) **where viruses are educated against robust mammalian immune responses**, and learn to [adapt and control the usual mechanisms that mammalian cells use to fight back](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2020.00026/full#h6).

The second aspect of this is that [**bat immune systems***](https://massivesci.com/articles/bat-immune-systems-ncov-sars-nipah-mers-ebola-coronavirus/) allow for [background replication of viruses](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6410205/) **at a low level, all the time, as a strategy to prevent symptomatic disease**. It's a trade-off, and one that bats have executed perfectly.

It just happens to mean that **when we get a virus from bats, oh man can it cause some damage**.

*I do have to say this one is mostly theory and inference, and there isn't amazingly good evidence to support it*. *But it's very likely that bat immune systems are different from our own, given [the overall divergence of their immune system genes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29253856/) in relation [to our own and those of other mammals](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7025585/).*

My opinion (*which echoes most ecologists*) is that [it's more about the position that bats hold in the environment](https://www.intechopen.com/books/bats/bats-bat-borne-viruses-and-environmental-changes), their behaviors, their longevity, and their sheer numbers. In general zoonotic transmission is a roulette, and bats have the most positions (*and the most advantageous positions*) on that wheel.

I think this idea has picked up so much steam because molecular biologists often find ways to use what they know about the micro world to explain phenomena in the macro world. It’s honestly probably counterproductive, since most things are quite a bit more complex than we realize while looking at their analogues in Petri dishes.

That being said, I also think ecologists often underestimate what is possible to figure out in a Petri dish, and undervalue the impact of a robustly well-controlled interventional experiment. But that's a conversation for another day.

# Bats can FLY!

This allows them to travel long distances, meet and interact with many different animals, hunt and be hunted, and survive to tell the tale. **Meaning they also survive to pass on their virus.**

---

# Bats are unusually long lived!

[**Many bat species live longer than 25 years**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12882342). On the curve of ""body size and metabolism"" vs ""lifespan"" [bats are a massive over-performer](https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/06/why-do-bats-have-such-bizarrely-long-lifespans/). The closely related foxes, for example, live on average 2-5 years in the wild.

This is probably interrelated with all the other factors listed. Bats can fly, so they live longer; bats live longer, so they can spread slowly growing virus infections better. This combination of long lifespan and persistent viral infection means that bats may, more often, keep viruses around long enough to pass them onto other vertebrates (like us!).

# Their social structure and hibernation behaviors

These characteristics are uniquely positioned to help them harbor a number of different viruses.

[Bats roost](https://www.bats.org.uk/about-bats/where-do-bats-live/bat-roosts/what-is-a-roost), meaning they hole up inside the roofs of caves and hibernate together for long periods of time (on the order of months), passing viruses amongst the colony in close isolation. [**The Mexican free-tailed bat, for example, packs \~300 bats/ft\^2 in cave systems**](https://tpwd.texas.gov/education/resources/keep-texas-wild/hanging-around-with-bats/a-year-in-the-life-of-a-mexican-free-tailed-bat) **like** [**Carlsbad caverns**](https://www.sunset.com/travel/carlsbad-confidential-the-bats) **in the southwestern United States.**

The complex social hierarchy of bats also likely plays a role. [**Bats exist in so-called ""micropopulations"" that have different migratory patterns**](https://www.researchgate.net/deref/http%3A%2F%2Fdx.doi.org%2F10.3906%2Fzoo-1508-56?_sg%5B0%5D=JXKzPLHkT5oojZLpKNaB1nsVgJvPk2x0CU3PgN5cO1SQ7hgTmkp0pZjIt6V7g-D_hnmZDJsDvmnZhNBdBsOvW2z-wQ.7zu_Efac5ALLeW8HlJfQISFbNLHoF6T0YXBun1ynaj1X1OeiAUt7geHm5s7BVbeto9mvEXWZ9VSn1Nbcfj_WkA). [They interweave and interact and combine and separate](https://www.researchgate.net/deref/http%3A%2F%2Fdx.doi.org%2F10.1134%2FS1062359014010105?_sg%5B0%5D=bMEntzSErKfgn7qaU7I16nuG74WfvYoY0vmRuuNnUYyo5yT8PLByWYocJ_8fq3oqwJ4MvHD_RXcoa6d1SubJCAoU5Q.EicnSr6EFfAwP2tWm6NSriLyNnbmCTcT-jztT9C18MZkDl42G8G-1anfVhFShDRYXMQaZPXPbN5iKBr4oH5Pug) in a dizzying mix of complex social networks among different ""micropopulations.""

A given virus may have the chance to interact with hundreds of thousands or millions of different individual bats in a short period of time as a result. This also means that viruses with different life cycles (short, long, persistent, with flare-ups, etc) can always find what they need to survive, since different bat groupings have different habits.

**And** [**this may partially explain how outbreaks of certain viruses happen according to seasonality**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3121824/). If you're a virus and your bat micropopulation of choice is around and out to play, it's more likely you will get a chance to jump around to different species.

# Echolocation may also play a role

Bats echolocate, and it involves the intense production of powerful sound waves, which are also perfect for disseminating lots of small virus-containing respiratory droplets across long distances! ([1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1539106/) [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4551426))

# Finally, a note on viral ecology in general:

**If you read this post, and think bats are the only ones out there with viruses, then I have failed.**

The reality is that **every species out there, from the tiniest stink bug to the massive elephant, likely has millions of different viruses infecting it all the time!** If you take [a drop (mL) of seawater, it contains \~10 million bacteriophages](https://hmr.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1007/BF01983537).

**In our genome, there are** [**remnants and scars and evidence of millions of retroviruses that once infected us**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogenous_retrovirus)**.** Greater than 8% of our genome is made up of these ""endogenous retroviruses,"" most of which don't make any RNA or proteins or anything like that. They just sit there. **They've truly won the war for remembrance**.

That's what viruses do, **they try and stick around for as long as possible**. *And, in a sense, these endogenous retroviruses have won*. They live with us, and get to stick around as long as we survive in one form or another.

**The vast vast majority of viruses are inert, asymptomatic, and cause no notable disease**. **It is only the very tip of the iceberg, the smallest tiny % of viruses, that cause disease and make us bleed out various orifices**. **Viral disease, in terms of all viruses, is the exception, not the rule. It's an accident.** **We are an accidental host for most of these ""zoonotic"" viruses.**

Viruses are everywhere, and it is only the unique and interesting aspects of bats noted above that mean we are forced to deal with their viruses more than other species.

(**Dengue, like most viruses, follows this idea**. The vast majority of people are asymptomatic. Pathogenicity and disease are the exception, not the rule. But that doesn't mean they don't cause damage to society and to lots of people! They do!)

[From: https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1038\/s41577-019-0123-x \(https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/KcuutRz.png\)](https://preview.redd.it/3dr6pt3e3nt41.png?width=2124&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6df2a3f92293bd8a900a7cd689304963cd7bac02)

**The last thing I want to reiterate at the end of this post is something I said earlier:**

*Bats are a keystone species!*

**A keystone species is one that, when you remove it, the system falls apart. Much like [the  keystone](https://images.app.goo.gl/HNZKSAGdWGzYns9HA) in an arched entryway.**

 Removing bats from the Earth would likely kill many more millions of humans than CoVID-19 or Ebola ever could.


**We rely on the plants they pollinate for the food we eat and for the air we breathe.**  **We rely on them for pest control and for population control.** **And, in turn, they serve as good for other crucial species.**


**Bat populations keep mosquitos like** ***Aedes*** **and** ***Anopheles*** **species in check.** *Aedes Aegypti*  kills many more millions than CoVID-19 by spreading dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, Zika, and other viruses. *Anopheles* females spread malaria, one of the most deadly diseases in human history. **Without bats, these mosquitoes could overgrow to unknown and unpredictable levels, and the diseases they transmit could spread even further, like wildfire, decimating the earth's human population.**  

In terms of pure biomass and impacts...*to remove 20% of mammals on the Earth*... That could be absolutely devastating! Possibly world-ending on its own.

We need bats.

We also don't know what would replace the niche that bats hold in the Earth's ecosystem. And whether or not *that* animal or animals would be worse or better for human zoonotic infections. 


**We need bats. We just don't need them to be close enough to human society that we contract their viruses so easily.**  


Other people have actually done this calculation. And they agree with me:  

(**[1](https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/esr/v8/n1-2/p93-115/) [2](https://www.theday.com/article/20100421/NWS01/304219877) [3](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/what-is-killing-the-bats-16824335/) [4](https://news.cgtn.com/news/2020-02-08/Bats-may-carry-virus-should-we-kill-them-all--NUxmfimhCU/index.html) [5](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2019/03/endangered-bats-killed-in-mauritius/) [6](https://fokt.pw/ecosystemservicesprovided.pdf) [7](https://peerj.com/articles/2249/?utm_source=TrendMD&amp;utm_campaign=PeerJ_TrendMD_1&amp;utm_medium=TrendMD) [8](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Justin_Welbergen/publication/270160641_The_impacts_of_extreme_events_on_biodiversity_-_lessons_from_die-offs_in_flying-foxes/links/54a197c40cf267bdb902c319.pdf) [9](http://kops.uni-konstanz.de/handle/123456789/35007)**)

We are researchers who work to understand the cause of and find treatments for human diseases. To do this, we use animals to help us model human conditions in the lab. Studying animal models is important because researchers need to show that therapies are safe and effective in animal models before they can be used in humans. Research in animal models has helped uncover the function of hundreds of genes that cause human diseases, including multiple new genetically-targeted drugs for cystic fibrosis, which was developed with the help of mouse, rat, pig, and ferret models. Cystic fibrosis is a rare, progressive, and severe disease that causes severe lung infections and breathing difficulties. Treatments developed based on information we have learned from animal models have allowed patients to live longer, healthier lives.

Scientific advances now allow us to pinpoint disease-causing changes across the human genome by studying their effects in animals. Let’s discuss!

On today’s panel we have:

**Claudia Gonzaga-Jauregui, PhD:** I am a geneticist and genomicist working on rare, undiagnosed, and Mendelian diseases. I currently work at Regeneron leading the Mendelian and rare disease genetics projects at the Regeneron Genetics Center. I analyze the genomic data derived from exome or genome sequencing of individual patients and families to identify the molecular causes of genetic disorders. I use animal models, primarily mouse, but have worked with zebrafish as well, to model the genetic variants identified in patients with genetic disorders to better understand their functional effects and consequences at the organismal level, and ultimately the disease. These animal models of disease can also serve to test treatments and therapies that can eventually help human patients.

**Elaine Ostrander, PhD:** I’m Chief and Distinguished Investigator of the Cancer Genetics and Comparative Genomics Branch at the National Human Genome Research Institute, at the National Institutes of Health.  My lab is interested in understanding the genetics of canine morphology, behavior and disease susceptibility. and to that end are using DNA sequencing to understand how breeds were developed and the selective mechanisms that lead to the diversity of breeds in the world today. Inherent in that diversity is breed susceptibility to specific diseases.  Our studies of canine cancer genes have informed human studies of similar cancers and provided a foundation for studies of common and rare cancers in humans and dogs.

**Hugo J Bellen, DVM, PhD**: I’m an investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and a Professor and Principle Investigator of the Model Organism Screening Center of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network at Baylor College of Medicine at the Neurological Research Institute of Texas Children Hospital. We collaborate with hundreds of physicians worldwide to help diagnose new human genetic disease. We use the fruit fly, *Drosophila melanogaster*, to study the corresponding genes, and test the variants found in patients in flies. Functional studies allow us to identify the biological or biochemical pathways in which these genes operate and sometimes identify drug targets that can be tested in flies and humans.

**Shawn Burgess, PhD:** I am a Senior Investigator at the National Human Genome Research Institute where I have worked for 19 years. The majority of my research uses zebrafish genetics and genomics to understand wound healing and organ regeneration. I have also worked with the Undiagnosed Diseases Program and other clinical researchers at the NIH to confirm candidate disease genes or study rare genetic disease pathologies using zebrafish as a model.

My doctoral thesis was on antibody responses against emerging viruses like Ebola, Hanta, and Zika. So you can imagine how much I care about getting this stuff right.

Recently, I've seen how often the topic of “immunity certificates” has come up. So I decided to write a longform introduction and answer a few questions.

**The explanation is long, but worth the read! I promise!**

---

#Q: Are ""immunity passes"" really a good idea?

#A: It's complicated, and I'm sorry for how complicated it is.

**TL;DR--A lot of things will need to happen correctly for this to be a good idea: specific criteria for who gets tested &amp; making sure that a positive on the test means you're truly immune to reinfection. Why? Because of the fundamental science of the test. But if it works, it could be a really good thing.**

---

Okay so we've come to the hard part of the curve. Companies are developing antibody tests, and people are asking ""*I already got sick, can I go back to work now???*"" Governments are considering implementing ""**immunity passes**"" or ""**immunity passports**"" to allow exactly that. It's at least a few months away, but an important discussion to start having now.

(*If you've never heard the term ""immunity pass,"" check out [this link](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/10/fauci-coronavirus-immunity-cards-for-americans-are-being-discussed-178784)*)

(*Important point: IgG serological tests are evaluating whether or not you've already had the virus and have gotten better. Not whether or not you currently have it. That is a different thing, often called a ""molecular test."" For more info, check out [this link](https://www.goodrx.com/blog/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-updates-methods-cost-availability/)*)

###*Why no test is perfect: Harry Potter and the paradox of Positive Predictive Value (PPV)*

To answer this question, we need to understand antibody tests and clinical testing in general. These tests are not infallible. **NO TEST IS PERFECT.** 

Good tests can, however, predict whether or not people are immune to the virus. 

(*if our understanding so far of reinfection holds true &lt;-- and that's a* ***big if,*** *keep reading*)

Any test, of any kind, has what's called a ""**Positive predictive value**"" i.e. *If you test positive, how likely is it that you're a true positive?* In this case, a true positive is someone who was already infected and has gotten better.

Even the best antibody test we have right now only has a **PPV of ~18% in the general population**. *Meaning if I just go out and test 10,000 random people, and 300 of them come up positive, 246 of those people will be ""false positives""* -- they didn't actually get infected and it wouldn't be safe to have them go back to normal life.

For more on this math, [here's an excellent thread from @taaltree](https://t.co/t7DqpMEwbc) (*I cannot overstate to you how good this thread is at explaining True and false positives/negatives, PPV, NPV. I don't get into it here with as much detail but it's very useful knowledge*)

**Think about PPV when you see studies where they use serological testing to estimate the extent of viral spread.** They will often test everyone indiscriminately, meaning their results are less accurate. And that's okay! Because they're not using the test to decide who can go back to work or w/e. They're using it to estimate the extent of disease in the general population. Different purpose. And they often correct for these sources of error, calculating that % of infected by only taking the proportion that are likely “true” positives. **Remember that, if they don’t correct for false positives, their results could be way off! 82% off even! Because of this PPV problem.**

---

###*Clinical tests are hard to make! A few reasons why:*

*And why is the PPV so low for general use? Because making good clinical tests is hard!*

One reason for this is because of how the testing works. These are some of the most ubiquitous clinical assays in the world. We use them all the time in the lab and in the clinic. Ever wondered how they check if your mumps or rubella vaccine worked when you were a kid? 

**They did an IgG serology test!**

An IgG serology test takes a certain CoV protein and puts it on a plate. Then it puts a part of your blood (*called ""serum""*) on top of those CoV proteins and asks ""*Do any of the antibodies in this serum bind this CoV?*"" If enough do (*and with enough strength*), then you've got a positive!

*IgG = A very specific antibody type called ""Immunoglobulin G""*

**The problem is that antibodies are sticky.** *They're supposed to be sticky. It's their job.* They stick to bad things in your blood/lungs so you don't get sick. So when we're trying to figure out if you have a certain antibody in your serum, we need to figure out how to detect that specific antibody and get it to stick to our SARS-2 “bait” without catching any of the other thousands of antibodies you have in your serum. Especially if you have any antibodies against other related viruses (*like [SARS-CoV-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus) ([the 2003 virus](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/covid-19/questions-answers)) or [MERS-CoV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East_respiratory_syndrome-related_coronavirus), or any of the ones that cause a common cold*). All of those antibodies could pose a problem. They do stuff like wash the plate with saline to make all those other sticky non-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies fall off. But it's not perfect. 

**Get the idea?**

It's especially hard to, with a quick and repetitive test, catch all the *right* sticky CoV antibodies (be ""**highly sensitive**""), but also as few of the *wrong* sticky non-CoV antibodies as possible (be ""**highly specific**""). It's a little more complicated than that, but that's the basic idea.

**As a result, it's difficult to make high PPV tests.** 

---

###*The influence of % infected on PPV*

The other reason is something that has nothing to do with the test itself: *how many people are actually infected in the population!* **The % infected!** [This is the single most influential statistic on PPV](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430867/). The lower the % infected in the group you're testing, the lower the PPV. And the opposite is also true: [higher prevalence, higher PPV](https://archivesphysiotherapy.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40945-019-0056-5). 

Said another way: 

**Fewer infected, more false positives**. **More infected, fewer false positives**. 

[With 1% infected, there will be ~82% false positives w/ Cellex's FDA-approved test](https://i.imgur.com/2mHKr6n.jpg).

**If we get to ~10% infected in the population, then all of a sudden the test becomes much better: [only around 30% false positives!](https://i.imgur.com/gXH9iFX.jpg)**. Corresponding visuals are from [twitter user @LCWheeler9000](https://twitter.com/LCWheeler9000/status/1249024017668780032). 

These images are not CoV-specific, though the math works out similarly. 

Between those two images, nothing about the actual test has changed. Nothing about the chemicals or the way we do it in the lab has changed. The only thing that has changed is the % infected in the population.

For a different visual explanation, check out [this video](https://youtu.be/QqgJHryKOSU?t=9).

[Here is a graph of PPV vs prevalence for the Cellex test](https://imgur.com/a/U3UskJv).

---

###*Okay, so how screwed are we?*

*Fortunately, there are things we can do to increase PPV!* 

* [If we only test people that have had symptoms, PPV goes up](https://jcm.asm.org/content/55/5/1244). 

* [If we use more than one test in a row, with different mechanisms, the PPV goes up](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15234632/). 

* [Retesting only positives with a new sample increases PPV](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3651832). 

* [If you only test people if they're in NY or WA, the PPV goes up](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5601285/).

* [If we only test people who were hospitalized, PPV goes WAY UP](https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797\(18\)30341-6/abstract)!  

* Et cetera.

**A test is not just the thing we put proteins and antibodies into, it's the entire regimen/plan around it.** The questions, the clinical judgment, etc. And so we need to do some experiments and publish papers to figure out the best way of testing!

If you combine these things as criteria, but only require one of them, you get a mixed bag between the worst and best criteria.  If you combine these things, and require *all of them* to administer the test, then the test is really good, but *almost nobody gets to have it done*! That's also a problem. 

There are basically **zero** tests that we give to anyone/everyone, regardless of clinical questionnaire. HIV is close, but even then we use multiple tests, ask about exposure, etc. to increase PPV.

(*If you're a virgin, and you've never used IV drugs or gotten a blood transfusion, much harder to get an HIV test. The same is likely gonna be true for people in low-risk CoVID areas with no recent travel or symptoms.*)

Ultimately papers will be published and clinical reviews written by panels of experts that debate what the best methods for testing CoV immunity are going to be. [Same thing happened in HIV](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2536748/). They weigh the pluses and minuses of having more or less strict criteria for who gets the test, and then they settle on the best combo. And that's usually what the CDC and FDA end up recommending.

**After that, we have the test!** (*yay!*) **but we will still continually have to reassess how that test is performing in use.** Forever, while it's being used, we need to know if it's being used correctly and if it's still doing its job.

---

###*How does this connect back to immunity certificates?*

We then need to figure out what relationship that ""*positive test result*"" actually has to ""*reinfection risk*."" I said [on a previous post](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MCgw2PgB52LqYorgA1O8bBaLS_e_gzUBhxuy_c8fpbM/edit) that it's really unlikely that the recovered can be reinfected (*in the short term*). 

**And I still believe that's true!** But I also need to tell you that ""*really unlikely*"" is just plain not good enough for this kind of decision. We need to keep checking and check in better and more innovative ways, and determine that a ""positive test result"" makes reinfection *very very very unlikely*.

*note I didn't say ""* ***antibodies*** *"" or ""* ***immunity*** *"" I said ""* ***positive test result*** .""* 

*I did this because when you're making these difficult decisions, you only have test results, not objective knowledge. You're viewing reality through a glass, darkly.*

---

#Reactive vs Neutralizing vs Protective antibodies

The other complication to this is that *antibodies* on their own, are not enough. You need to have a certain *type* of antibodies and *in large enough quantities in your blood* in order to actually be protected against reinfection. This is the part we really need to investigate further before this is safe. 

A “***reactive***” antibody is one that just binds to the protein it’s been made against. It would be useful in detecting the virus in a lab test, but not very useful in helping you avoid getting sick.

A “***neutralizing***” antibody is one that binds the virus in a very special way, that prevents the virus from getting into your cells. These are the antibodies we need to see in your blood. And we actually need to see them *in high enough amounts* as well. This is what is called a **correlate of protection**.

Normally, for most viral diseases, what we do is we get a big group of animals (usually mice, but sometimes ferrets or monkeys), and we vaccinate them, and figure out how much of the second kind of antibody (neutralizing) they have in their blood. Then we try our hardest to infect them. And we figure out at what level of neutralizing antibody they stop getting sick. This is then called the “**protective antibody titer**” (titer meaning “count”). 

We have just drawn a “correlate of protection.” By correlating protection (not getting infected) with something we can measure (*neutralizing* antibody level in the blood).

This can take a long time to be accepted in the scientific community. For CoV, since it’s a problem *right now*, it may be done differently, by statistically analyzing huge groups of humans, but will also likely be done in animals like I just described at some point down the road. But in the next section I get into more detail about epidemiologically *proving* immunity.

* [Oxford University has an article on the complexities of this](https://www.research.ox.ac.uk/Article/2020-04-05-trouble-in-testing-land) if you want more detail.
---

###*How are we actually going to do this? Clinical Trials!*

What's likely going to happen, is researchers here and in other countries are going to do some small scale trials, with the best possible methods, to try and figure out who is immune. And whether those immune individuals are unable to get reinfected.

We need to do both molecular (*in the lab*) and epidemiological (*in huge groups of humans*) studies about this and figure out if and how we can evaluate immunity.

[**Germany is already starting to test the waters**](https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/10/immunity-certificates-covid-19-practical-ethical-conundrums/). Based on both objective (*i.e. were you in the hospital*) and subjective (*did you have symptoms*) criteria, they give you the test. Only some people actually get it. And that's not necessarily because we won't have enough, although there will likely also be supply chain issues. It's also because a test doesn't work as well if we give it to anyone and everyone (as I said above). 

And then after they do all that testing, they're going to do one of two things: 

(*different countries will likely do A or B, depending on their ethical appetite for A*)

**A)** involves what are called [**challenge studies**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1757139/) where they actually straight up try their hardest to infect the people who have a positive IgG test.  

And I recognize this is not super palatable to a lot of people. *Purposely infecting humans??* *Knowing that some might get sick??* 

Well they would only do this in young people (18-40) with very low risk for death or disability. And they only do it in the extremely safe environment of a clinical trial where you're being closely monitored and given the best medical care money can buy. 

And it's done for the good of society! The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, etc. We give people money to participate, make sure they understand the risks, and so on.

(*A may be less likely in the US, given the government’s risk aversity, though it could be done safely [in young people] in my opinion.*)

**B)** involves giving a bunch of people this best possible testing regimen (multiple tests, pre-screen, w/e) and then you [**separate them into two groups**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2998589/). 

**Group 1 was positive** on the test, **Group 2 was negative**.  You let both groups go about their lives and then you continually monitor them extremely closely (swabbing their noses once or twice a day) and figure out if they're getting reinfected or capable of spreading virus.

If Group 1 (IgG+ via the test) gets the virus less often than Group 2 ( IgG- via the test), and to a degree that we're all comfortable with (*let's say 100x less often, again panels of experts and a few lay people will decide this*), then we let the positives go do their thing in society.  

(*Note: there's always lay people on these panels for the public perspective! Don't let anyone say that America doesn't respect the opinion of the common man*.)

**A&gt;B in terms of proof of immunity = no reinfection**. Option A also requires fewer people than B. Option B will likely need many thousands to be properly ""powered"" (*statistical term meaning capable of telling with reasonable confidence*) to answer the question of reinfection risk. But A can probably be done with a few hundred people. 

And if it turns out that reinfection risk is less common in the test + group, then we let this test + group go back to patronizing businesses and possibly helping with relief efforts, go back to work, etc. 

---

###*The role of PPV and Herd Immunity in this rollout*

And we'll have to develop a second PPV, let's call it **PPV2**. **PPV1** is ""*how likely was it that you had the virus, given a positive test result?*"" **PPV2** is ""*how likely is it that you are immune and unable to get reinfected, given a positive test result?*"" 

Two separate questions, two separate PPVs. 

**PPV2 needs to be high enough for ""immunity certificates"" to be possible.** 

**Exactly how high is probably a factor of herd immunity.** If we can be confident that 70ish% of these people are true positives, then  herd immunity could be enough. This needs to be modeled based on the R0. 

**R0 is a number called ""infectivity.""** -- basically means: *If I'm infected, how many people do I spread the virus to? Estimates for CoV's R0 vary widely, between 2.5 at the lowest and 6 at the highest. It's a living and breathing number that factors in how well we are ""sheltering in place.""*

But we can't just count the population we tested, *we'd have to also count the essential workers those tested people will have to interact with*, who *may not have gotten the test*, and *may not have antibodies*! It would have to be 70% of ALL PEOPLE who aren't in self-isolation to be true positives for that to work.

***70% = (True positives)/(all the positives + all essential workers)***

But even if we do issue these ""immunity certificates,"" we have to [keep checking, continually, to make sure that their immunity is still holding true](https://www.oie.int/doc/ged/D9467.PDF). We can let all the positive people go back to higher risk activities, but then we need to keep doing B continually, and checking to make sure the positives are not at higher risk. 

**And so even if we do A at first, we often end up doing B afterwards on a rolling basis.** We need to make sure these ""immune"" people aren't getting reinfected at a higher rate than the sheltered-in-place. Or at least at not at *too much higher* of a rate. If they are getting reinfected too often, it won't be worth it to let them return to businesses, help out with relief efforts, etc. They would pose too great a risk to everyone else.

If the numbers aren't good, then we're SOL until a better testing regimen comes along, or until we get a vaccine. But there is *a chance* at present that this will play out in our favor.

But if it does work, and the IgG+ are incapable of reinfection for the most part, then they could help slowly restart our economy and slowly help society return to normal...

**This is probably one of the most complex, annoying, and counterintuitive parts of medical statistics, clinical pathology, etc. And it's not easy for people to understand, even doctors and scientists have trouble with this!**

---

###*Other things to consider:*

* **We need national legislation making it illegal to discriminate against WFH**, or in any way restrict WFH (*work from home*) in non-essential industries/jobs. We cannot let the disabled or the elderly get the short end of the stick just because the immune healthy people get to go back to work IRL.

* **The testing would need to be offered for free or at low cost via the local health department**, so it doesn't make worse inequities among the haves and have-nots.

* **It needs to be prioritized for healthcare workers and other essential workers**, so we are protecting the non-immune ones from infection as much as possible. These essential workers are a resource, as much as ventilators and medicines. We need to conserve them and keep them healthy!

* **We need to be careful about [intentional infection](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/g1ty3g/are_immunity_certificates_actually_feasible/fnhvg4o) (CoVID Parties)**. The only way to implement something like this is *slowly* and *methodically*. We would have to do two things: 

&gt;A) Examine how other countries do it and how it’s going (Because I think Americans, for example,  are individualistic and crazy enough to lick doorknobs, but I’m not sure they’re that much crazier or desperate than, say, Germans, French, or Italians); 

&gt;B) Do it slowly, and study the prevalence of these “**negative internalities**” (*figure out how much bad shit is actually happening as a result of the certificates*). 

It may not even be intentional infections that are the issue! **[People could forge certificates](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/g1ty3g/are_immunity_certificates_actually_feasible/fnhxpaa)**. 

All of these costs would need to be measured, and compared to the benefits. Things like *more  jobs, fewer bankruptcies, improved mental health, fewer suicides,* etc. If negative effects outweigh positive ones, **then we probably shouldn’t implement it.** 

If we’re going to act like scientists, in a conversation about public policy &amp; public health, then we need to do so free from inherent biases or preconceived notions. **We need to put all the cards on the table, see which ones work, and then play them.** 

“Immunity certificates” is just one card in that hand.

###*The NIH is starting a serosurvey!*

Also check out [this study from the NIH](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/nih-begins-study-quantify-undetected-cases-coronavirus-infection) and consider participating if you qualify. 

(Email clinicalstudiesunit@nih.gov to participate)

**They're testing only people with no history of a prior result (+ or -).** *If you've ever been tested, you can't sign up.* But for everyone else, go for it! These studies will help improve the models we have and help us understand the test itself! By getting a better estimate of overall % infected and recovered. 

**But remember this essay, bookmark it, and come back and reread it when you see the NIH study's results. And think about how PPV and prevalence are directly linked. Lower % infected, more false positives.** 

**And remember also that these studies are not yet designed to figure out if these people are actually *immune* to reinfection. They’re trying to figure out who has already been infected. Different questions. Different approaches. Different studies.**

**Additionally, I'll be in and out of this thread to answer any questions that come up in the comments. Fire away! I'm always down to talk about science.**

science,t3_g4sku7,Science Discussion Series: We are cannabis experts here to chat with you about the current state of cannabis research. Let's discuss!,"Hi reddit! Today seems like a good day to talk about what we know (and don’t know) about the health effects of cannabis and the emerging evidence about adult-use legalization. With so much attention being paid to the political, economic and social impacts of cannabis, it’s important for the scientific community to provide evidence-based input that can be used as a basis for these crucial discussions.

During this AMA organized by [LabX](https://labx.org/), a public engagement program of the National Academy of Sciences, we’ll answer your questions about the current state of cannabis research, discuss how laboratory research is being implemented clinically, and talk about the implications on policy. We’ll also provide links to high-quality, evidence-based resources about cannabis.

In particular, we’ll highlight the 2017 report “[The Health Effects of Cannabis and Cannabinoids](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/24625/the-health-effects-of-cannabis-and-cannabinoids-the-current-state)” from the National Research Council, which explored the existing research on the health impacts of cannabis and included several conclusions and recommendations for scientific researchers, medical professionals, policymakers and the general public.

With us today are:

I am **Dr. Ziva Cooper**, Research Director for UCLA’s [Cannabis Research Initiative](https://www.uclahealth.org/cannabis/) and Associate Professor at the [Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior](https://www.semel.ucla.edu/) and Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences. My research involves understanding the neurobiological, pharmacological, and behavioral variables that influence both the abuse liability and therapeutic potential of cannabinoids (cannabis, cannabinoid receptor agonists, and cannabidiol) and opioids. Over the last ten years, I have sought to translate preclinical studies of drug action to the clinic using controlled human laboratory studies to investigate the direct effects of abused substances.

I am **John Kagia**, Chief Knowledge Officer with [New Frontier Data](https://newfrontierdata.com/). I have developed market leading forecasts for the growth of the cannabis industry, uncovered groundbreaking research into the cannabis consumer, and led the first-of-its-kind analysis of global cannabis demand. In addition, I have played an active role in advising lawmakers and regulators looking to establish and regulate cannabis industries.

I am **Dr. Beau Kilmer**, director of the [RAND Drug Policy Research Center](https://www.rand.org/well-being/justice-policy/centers/dprc.html). I started as an intern at RAND more than 20 years ago and never really left! Some of my current projects include analyzing the costs and benefits of cannabis legalization; facilitating San Francisco’s Street-level Drug Dealing Task Force; and assessing the evidence and arguments made about heroin-assisted treatment and supervised consumption sites. I have worked with a number of jurisdictions in the US and abroad that have considered or implemented cannabis legalization and am a co-author of the book “Marijuana Legalization: What Everyone Needs to Know.”

I am **Dr. Bryce Pardo**, associate policy researcher at the [RAND Corporation](https://www.rand.org/). My work focuses on drug policy with a particular interest in the areas of cannabis regulation, opioid control, and new psychoactive substance markets. I have over ten years of experience working with national, state, and local governments in crime and drug policy, and I served as lead analyst with BOTEC Analysis Corporation to support the Government of Jamaica in drafting medical cannabis regulations.

I am **Dr. Rosanna Smart**, economist at the [RAND Corporation](https://www.rand.org/) and a member of the Pardee RAND Graduate School faculty. My research is in applied microeconomics, with a focus on issues related to health behaviors, illicit markets, drug policy, gun policy and criminal justice issues. I have worked on projects estimating the health consequences of increased medical marijuana availability on spillovers to illicit marijuana use by adolescents and mortality related to use of other addictive substances, as well as understanding the evolution and impact of recreational marijuana markets.

We will be back this afternoon (\~3 pm Eastern) to answer questions and discuss cannabis research with you!

nature,t3_g9mpmx,Concept - Finding the motivation to go outside into nature via a herb collection story," 

I love collecting herbs in the wild, its like finding treasures! And thus its motivating me to go outside in the first place, which can sometimes be a challenge tbh xD

And now since I have to do a project about plants in uni for my design class I decided to make it a ""Herb Collecting in the Wild"" thingy in context of a semi fantasy story. You might not be able to imagine the technology well, its not important anyway, I just want to know more about how I could make it cool for others, i dont just want to cook my own little dandelion soup :D

So imagine you are walking through the woods, as a young apprentice of a deceased herbs master, with his book in tow and his voice, trapped in the pages, guiding you through the forest. The little village you come from has recently seen some mysterious events and through the discovery of the herbs, you can slowly unwrap what has happened. You move through the story be scanning certain checkpoints in the area, your phone then shows you the plant that typically grows in this place and where you might find it.

Now many of you might know their herbs anyway, but do you think, for someone who doesnt know anything yet, this would be a nice little motivation for them to go outside and have a look? Or do you find it kinda boring. Thats fine, I wanna make it as interesting as possible!

Share any ideas and thoughts that you have if you want to :)

I’ve seen some interesting documentaries about the Physarum Polycephalum (also called the Blob). It’s a unicellular organism but also a special type of mushroom which grows pretty fast and has some sort of intelligence. I was wondering if someone knows how hard it is to find a Blob, in which type of ecosystem I could find one and maybe give me some advices on how to treat it.

I haven't observed any other pair of bulbuls in the vicinity.

The proposal would do this by barring the EPA from considering studies where the raw data isn't completely publicly available. 

In effect,  this rule would exclude most research that demonstrates the harmful health effects of air pollution, water pollution and pesticide exposure.That's because that research of that kind -- including the Six Cities study which led to the Clean Air Act -- uses raw data from confidential health records. It's not the kind of data that can be made available to the general public, and the EPA wouldn't be able to take it into account under this new rule.

nature,t3_g1998u,Professional Development During COVID-19,"I'm a High School Senior in Miami, Florida, and soon to be Freshmen at Florida International University, in the Fall of 2020 to study Marine Biology. In the future, I intend to specialize in the study and conservation of threatened and endangered wildlife.

I applied for my local zoo's Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Program, for this summer, but it was canceled due to the global spread of COVID-19.

I'm looking for ways to educate myself and get involved in wildlife conservation since I'm unable to volunteer/work at my local zoo by any means. I'm not sure what to do.

I'm considering becoming an Associate Member of the Zoological Registrar Association to participate in their Training Certificate Program, but I would like to know if anyone has any experience with the ZRA and/or their certificate program.

I would also really like to know if anyone has any recommendations for either a program I can work/volunteer/intern for or online certification that I can learn from.

I really want to find something useful that I can do during this time to further my own education and assist in my future career.

Thank you so much for your time, please stay safe!"

nature,t3_fms6jg,Why do male lions kill cubs?,"It was originally proposed that male lions kill cubs to bring the females back into estrus. This has been disproven, but the original thinking was that if a male lion coalition takes over a pride of females, they cannot sit around and wait until the cubs are grown and the females then become receptive again. Better to kill the cubs that are not theirs, and start a new generation that is theirs – as male coalitions have a limited time with the prides. Male lions do kill cubs when they take over a pride, but it is not as prevalent as some would have us think. 

&amp;#x200B;

Females already pregnant when the new males come in can easily “disguise” their cubs as belonging to the new males, and even females with newly born cubs can hide them, mate with the new males, and bring their cubs out later. Females are clever, and males subsequently end up with offspring not theirs."

But the odd thing is that some of the plants that shoot up from the roots, don't have leaves or berries and they spread fiber everywhere when it's damaged. I also found another plant that I don't think is the same and it uses fiber to latch on to branches to climb up. Although it could be the plant in its early stages.

nature,t3_f6sbic,Need Advice,"Okay so, this is a long shot and I don’t know if this is the place to ask. But I’m tired of seeing rabbits die for no reason. 

I live in a neighborhood that has quite a lot of rabbits. We currently have babies visiting our yard each morning. We don’t know where their homes are, and in desperation a few of us in the neighborhood have tried watching them to see where they go, thinking the only option we have is to have them safely caught and removed by professionals and relocated somewhere else. 

The issue is, is that assholes keep speeding down our street. We’ve had 5 rabbits die between just two houses, since January. I just picked one up off the road two weeks ago and just had to do so this morning. We’re now super worried there’s a bunch of babies somewhere without a mother. We see super tiny baby rabbits every morning the last two weeks so we’re hoping it’s a time in the season where they’re all big enough to fend for themselves. But now we worry about them going in the road. 

I know it’s a long shot but is there anything we can do to keep them off the road or keep them from getting hit? If people would just slow down, the issue would be resolved. We’re going to be putting a sign up. It was originally going to read “SLOW! RABBIT CROSSING! YOU HIT A RABBIT, AND WE HIT YOU!”, but we decided the city maaaaay not approve of that one. It might be a tad...problematic..... 

One of our neighbors has the idea to buy urine from one of rabbits predators and sort of sprinkle it alongside each side of the road, but I don’t know if that would make things worse or not or even work to keep them away from the road. 


Any ideas on how we can prevent rabbits getting killed? We love having them around. We don’t know if we should have someone try to catch all the self sufficient babies and move them somewhere safer. Or what we can do. I appreciate any advice or help and sorry if this isn’t quite the place to ask this. 

Side note, we know about the circle of life and all that. And we know, as a neighborhood, that these rabbits are feeding predators and scavengers who also need to eat. But these rabbits are dying at a pace that just isn’t right. If it was one or two here or there, fine. It’d suck. But fine. The problem is, when you’ve got 5 rabbits in the span of a month and a half dying in a small section of the road, that it becomes problematic to us. There’s no sense in it."

I think there were two about sea birds. One was birds (man o war?) Eating other birds. One was the birds who learn to fly as sharks surround the island.

There was one where sharks followed small whales.

One where a turtle gets cleaned by tangs and the narrator mentions 'thats got to feel good'.

And again humanity views the ground as insignificant.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Take a look at deforestation and pollution.

&amp;#x200B;

* Destruction shows itself now and we require action to stop it.
* Trees are dying in industrialized harvesting.
* The oceans are polluted with the waste of humans.
* Renewable energy-sources are not transitioning quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*There is a lack of ingenuity materialising to help the workers in oil and fossil fuels to transition into a career that involves renewable resources.There is a lack of motivation in humanity as a whole to clean up its land-fills. To search for recyclables.*

It should be mandated to sort out trash after it leaves your home for recyclables. Not a single bottle cap should be left un-recycled.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is humans and the solution is simple.

1. Follow ethics in the corporate world.
2. Follow ethics at an individual level. Be diligent and teach an entire generation to be greener than the last.

If the whole of humanity does this in enough numbers then an entire generation will be born to reverse some of the damage that's already be done.

The longer it takes the worse it'll get."
nature,t3_eu3vqn,Researcher looking for clues in the mystery of the Grand Canyon's water supply,
nature,t3_etzar2,Plastic Pollution - Can we make a difference?," 

Everyday we buy so many products which has either plastic parts or plastic packaging that it's almost unavoidable, not to have plastic pollution to our names.  Soon enough these products end up in our trash and we all know where our waste goes, once it is of our homes - to landfills, air, rivers and oceans, contaminating every bit of our ecosystem that it touches. Each day we are throwing away tons of plastic and there is only so much our ecosystem can take. But with conscious effort we can reduce the amount of plastic waste we generate and steer society towards a sustainable living.

The first question that comes in our mind is where to begin? how to transform our lives to eco-friendly living, do I have to make any compromises in my lifestyle. Is it going to easy or difficult?. The answer to these these questions is - ""its complicated"".

But it can be simplified by having an inward look at our lifestyle and making the right choices.

In order to transform our lives to an eco-friendly, symbiotic and low-carbon footprint lifestyle, we need to examine our daily lives and find avenues of plastic encounter. 

For an eco conscious consumer it is important to ask 3 simple questions while buying a product with non biodegradable content or packaging  -

1. Is there any biodegradable alternative available?

2. Can it be recycled?

3. How much value does this product add to our life over a period of time.

*Is there any biodegradable alternative available?*

If the answer is yes then we should always try to buy the biodegradable alternatives. But it is easier said than done, it takes time to do the research and find sellers with eco-friendly products. Sometimes they are also little costlier than their non eco friendly counterpart but in the end it's worth it, in the bigger scheme of things. Also, time to find these products &amp; premium price comes down with increase in popularity and buyer base. As for any other mass production, Manufacturers can apply economies of scale and bring down the cost of a popular product. one issue still remain, that all alternatives might not perform the exact same task as the original product and it may have some reduced functionalities. As a consumer we have to judge whether we can work with it or not. For e.g. we might be using an electric toothbrush today but since we don't have bamboo electric toothbrushes available in the market, the only eco-friendly alternative available is manual bamboo toothbrush. If we cannot work with the alternatives at all, then we move to the next question.

*Can it be recycled?*

This applies for both content and packaging. We should favor the product which are 100% recyclable products(with eco-friendly packaging) over partially or non recyclable products. Recycling requires a whole setup to gather and sort through the thrown away items, it also requires a lot of energy to recycle. But it is still better than non recyclable products. According to an estimate, we are still using aluminium in our soda cans that were first mined in 1900s. So even though these packaging are non biodegradable, at least it is part of a cyclic economy.  But before we start dumping everything we remotely consider recyclable, we must be mindful about 'Wishcycling' too. Wishcycling is tossing  trash in recycling bin without checking if it is actually recyclable or not. This is even more harmful as it contaminates the entire bin and everything ends up in landfill. Therefore, we need to know what can be recycled, sort our recyclables, find the right recycling dumping places and discard them properly.

*How much value does this product add to our life over a period of time.*

Now if our answer to both the questions is negative, then we need to look the value addition of the product in our lives. If a product performs useful functions over a period of time and would be remain usable for a long time, it makes sense to buy it. A kitchen appliance with plastic parts is a good example of this category. A mixer- blender makes our daily kitchen activities easier and is used for at least 5-10 years. But that doesn't mean it has no environmental implications. To reduce our carbon footprints and limit plastic pollution is to buy an energy efficient &amp; durable product that can serves us for a longer period. Good maintenance extends the usable life of products even further. We also need to start asking questions to manufacturer about proper disposal of durable products so that majority of its parts could be recycled or reused.

Following these simple rules can help us choose the products that are friendlier to environment. Initially, It may seem like too much change in one's habit for too little impact but remember billions of people not acknowledging their role in the bigger picture, has gotten us to a place we are in. And there is the thing about habits, it can be changed and you can get habitual to a new way of living!

If you care about plastic pollution then you are not alone, there are changes happening in every industry where companies are trying to find better materials which are as durable &amp; easy to use as plastics and at the same time does not pollute our ecosystem for generations to come. But right now the changes are very slow and ineffective. This movement requires a strong propellant, and this propellant could be us, the consumer! "

He first showed up about 3 weeks ago and hasn't changed much in size,  and is alone. Is this a baby, or a possum old enough to be by himself? He's about the size of a large rat, and is standing next to a large (20-25 feet?) palm tree.  I am just wondering if I should call a wildlife rescue or just leave him be."

nature,t3_eqwx7n,Is more Biodiversity noticeably better?,"In my life, I have only been exposed to areas of countryside that I fear that many environmentalists and ecologists would consider to be deprived of biodiversity. These include pastures, conifer plantations, and small, thin or fragmented areas of woodland, as well as public ponds and parks, and the coastline. Yet, despite this, I still feel a very similar sense of contendness, awe and passion towards the Natural Environment, and I still love to walk through it and explore it, despite it being 'deprived'.

I do not believe that I am isolated in my experience; George Monbiot has described how moorland and grasslands are being held in a less biodiverse plagioclimax by grazing and burning, yet countless naturalists and conservationists dedicate large swathes of their time to protecting these habitats and have written very poetic descriptions of them, which I am loathe to deny the emotional sincerity of.

I do notice certain differences in biodiversity; I am often colder and more exposed to the wind in the plantations than in the woodlands as the woodlands are denser and have a thicker understory, and the relative absence of animals, and the resultant 'emptiness', in the plantation is disturbing. But I am not sure if the noticeable benefit of biodiversity extends much further than this.

I am concerned that I may be suffering from a lack of lived experience in truly biodiverse areas, and from the 'shifting baseline syndrome' (I am relatively young, as I am only in my late teens). Are biodiverse woodlands noticeably better, and do they induce stronger emotions? 

For comparison, in the woodlands near my home, which form a strip along one hill of a valley that follows the flow of a river, the understory is mostly brambles or bracken, with the occasional empty space that is filled with leaf-litter, along with a few, but seemingly scarce, groups of wildflowers. The trees have a variety of ages, and are covered in various mosses and lichens. I disturb a few birds (\~15 species in total, but only around half a dozen on any given walk) and squirrels (only one species of squirrel) along my path, and can find bats (judging by the frequency of their calls, no more than two species) in the evening during the Summer, but I only see other animals (foxes, mice, rats and a single weasel) on an extremely infrequent basis. Invertebrates can be found during the Summer, but only when actively searched for, unless they have strayed onto the path. The river has a small variety of birds (mallards, mergansers, dippers and herons) and has invertebrates (flukes, stonefly and caddisfly larvae) that can be found by disturbing the sediment or overturning pebbles.

Would a biodiverse woodland be noticeably better? Would I encounter animals more frequently? Would the understory be thicker and more diverse? Do you believe that I would experience stronger emotional and mental benefits from being exposed to a greater biodiversity? Are, if you can tell from my brief descriptions, the local woodlands actually biologically deprived (They are part of the 'Sirhowy Valley Country Park', if that is of any use)?

I apologise for the multitude of questions, and for being somewhat incoherent, but I would be very grateful for any help that you could offer. Photographs comparing biodiverse with not biodiverse woodland would be appreciated (I have tried 'googling', but could not find a clear comparison). Thank you very much in advance for your help."

nature,t3_eq81l3,Lets talk about Neotrogla,"Neotrogla are a type of lice. Well, cave lice to be specific. They live in Brazil and subsist on a steady diet of bat shit. They are about the size of a flea, so very, very small compared to the other animals in this book.  Surprising to no one, while great for fertilizer, bat shit isn't exactly full of nutritional value. In order to combat this impressive lack of sustenance, these cave lice developed a new paradigm. The males evolved to have the vaginas, and the ladies get to chase after them with their penises. It's all very modern and new age.

The standard gender roles are a little reversed as you might expect. The females are extremely aggressive in searching out mates, while the males are fairly selective. When mating, the females will mount the male from behind and penetrate his genital opening with her gynosome (penis). Her penis will swell and deploy barbs to prevent unwanted removal. This will begin the process of sex, where semen and nutrients are removed from the male through her penis. Like a sexual straw she drains him of life-giving material. This love making can last up to 70 hours.

Neotrogla might have evolved this method to help mitigate the female’s energy burden from being pregnant. Trying to forage enough energy for a new mother would require eating a significant amount of bat poop. The male helps out by spending most of his life building up nutrient supplies and semen, later providing it for his mate like some kind of sexual lunchable. There have even been instances of females mounting and sucking the juices from juvenile males who were too young to reproduce, all in the name of an easy meal."
