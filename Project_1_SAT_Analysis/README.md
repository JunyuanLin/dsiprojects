##### by: Lin Junyuan, SG-DSI-14

## Introduction
SAT introduced a new format in 2016. Being an employee of the College Board, my role is to track statewide participation rates and score results. Using the data collected, the objective is to recommend where to invest money to improve SAT participation rates.

## Problem Statement

**What is the best state to invest money in to raise SAT participation rates?**

## Executive Summary

This project attempts to identify the best candidate state to invest in to improve participation rates. The data provided initially are two years' worth (2017 and 2018) of participation rates in percentages and mean scores in individual subjects as well as the Total/Composite scores, organized by state.

Initial analysis of the data shows a rather consistent relationship between some of the variables. 
- In every state, there is an inverse relationship between the participation rate of any of the tests and its mean scores, meaning low participation results in high mean test scores, and vice versa,
- Between tests, there is also an inverse relationship in their participation rates. States with high ACT participation tends to have low SAT participation, and vice versa.

However, it is not recommended to directly compare mean scores between ACT and SAT, even in similar subjects. Due to the lack of information such as the state student population and whether there are students who took both tests, statistical inferences cannot be made. 

By using the original data and generating a database that tracks the change in each variable over the course of one year, it is observed that states that has larger change in their participation rates also meet with larger change in their mean scores, and, more interestingly, several states saw rather drastic changes in SAT or ACT participation rates. 

By conducting external research on these states, it is found that state education policy change is the main reason behind the change. By obtaining each state's high school education policy, **South Dakota** is the one of the states with low SAT participation rates and has yet to make either SAT or ACT mandatory for its high school students.

 ## Conclusions and Recommendations

In conclusion, there are inverse relationships 
-   between participation rates of the two tests, 
-   between each test's participation rates and its scores and 
-   also between each test's change in participation rates and its change in scores. 

However, it is more likely that participation rates is the influencing mean scores rather than the other way round. One key takeaway is that states usually prefer one test over another and are likely to focus more on one test only.

Instead, state education policy is the decisive factor that impacts participation rates. From the examples of Colorado and Illinois, the shift of state wide testing from ACT to SAT as mandated by each state's Department of Education proved to be the decisive factor that drastically raised SAT participation rates.

Amongst the states with the lowest SAT participation rates, **South Dakota** does not make either SAT or ACT mandatory for its high school students. It is recommended that the College Board invest money into South Dakota to advocate adopting SAT for their students and educators. 

Taking Illinois as an example , it switched over from ACT to SAT after evaluating SAT's merits despite also being a midwestern state,  where attitudes tend towards using ACT tests score for college admission. The points that Illinois considered were: the revamped format, SAT's supporting programmes such as the reporting system, the  partnership with Khan Academy providing free test preparation and the SAT School day allows lower income families to gain access to colleges. 

 This advocacy can also be extended to South Dakota colleges. As the main driving reason for these tests is for college admission, convincing colleges in this region to be receptive of considering SAT scores will also be helpful.

A potential threat is the test-optional movement. Colleges are increasingly performing admission evaluation without SAT or ACT, claiming that these scores do not necessarily accurately predict student success. Therefore, more studies need to be conducted to verify these claims and strategise how to identify areas which can bring value to colleges that uses SAT scores for admission. This will ensure relevancy and keep SAT participation rates high.
